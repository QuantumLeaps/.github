# Beyond the RTOS
The unique Quantum Leaps ecosystem enables embedded developers to move beyond
the traditional RTOS and apply the
[Active Object (a.k.a. Actor) design pattern](https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/srs-qp_ao.html),
[hierarchical state machines](https://www.state-machine.com/fsm#HSM),
[model based design](https://www.state-machine.com/mbd) and automatic
code generation in small embedded systems, such as ARM Cortex-M MCUs
(micro-controller units). Since 2005, this modern approach and practical,
efficient software have been delivering a competitive advantage to
[hundreds of companies](https://www.state-machine.com/customers/) around the world
in a wide [variety of markets](https://www.state-machine.com/customers/#Markets).
